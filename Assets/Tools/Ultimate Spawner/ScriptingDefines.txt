Ultimate pooling has built in support for networking using Unity's 'uNet' system as well as pooling using our separate 'Ultimate Pooling' asset which can be found here (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64950).
Support for both of these is disabled by default as not everyone will have these instaled.

Support for these systems can be easily activated via the use of scripting define symbols. 
Go to 'Edit -> Project Settings -> Player' and select the 'Other Settings' area. Note that you should make sure your target platform is selected.
You can enter scripting define symbols in the field labeled as such. Note that more than one entry can be added to the input field by separating entries with a semicolon ';'

To enable networking add: ULTIMATE_SPAWNER_NETWORKED
To enable pooling add: ULTIMATE_SPAWNER_POOLED
