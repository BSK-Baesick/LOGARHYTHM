Unity version (5.1.0f3)
The following error may appear in the editor console when a client player shoots an enemy in the networked scene example:

InvokeCommand class [FPSController] doesn't match [Shoot])
-NetworkIdentity::UNetStaticUpdate()

This is a known Unity bug and the error message is harmless.
The bug is fixed in later versions.
