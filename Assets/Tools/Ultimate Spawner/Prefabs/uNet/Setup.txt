By default all networking is disabled and all scripts are used in single player mode. Note that the networked prefabs provided will not function correctly when in this default mode.
To activate networking you will need to add a scripting define symbol to the player settings.
Follow the steps below to add a define symbol and enable networking.

1/ Go to 'Edit/ProjectSettings/Player'
2/ Find the section labeled 'OtherSettings' for your target platform
3/ Find the field called 'Scripting Define Symbols'
4/ add the following define symbol to enable networking: 'ULTIMATE_SPAWNER_NETWORKED'
5/ Check the build settings and make sure that your current platform matches the platform that you added the scripting define symbol for.
6/ Allow Unity to recompile the scripts and you will now have networking enabled.

Once these steps are completed you can use the prefabs located in the 'UltimateSpawner/Prefabs/uNet' folder.
