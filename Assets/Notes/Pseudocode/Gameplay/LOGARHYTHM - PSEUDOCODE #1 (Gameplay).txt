PSEUDOCODE NO. #1

SUBJECT:

Starting BEAT Game Logic

PROBLEM TYPE:

Gameplay



v1.0 (PRIMARY CODE FEATURES)

THE GENERAL PROBLEM: 

Implementing the starting core gameplay

THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM:

1.) Spawn the Starting BEAT at the origin of the game world.

2.) If the Starting BEAT gameObject has been Tap, then destroy the gameObject.

==NOTE==

Use the EasyTouch5 asset for faster development speed.

3.) Play the stage music "once" after the Starting BEAT has been Tap and before the gameObject is destroyed.

4.) Then, spawn BEATz randomly depending on the level design.

v2.0 (SECONDARY FEATURES - This process can be skipped in the early phase of development)

THE GENERAL PROBLEM:

Improving the script

THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM:

1.) We can still improve the script and game speed by using the asset Master Audio to instantiate the stage music once
without worrying about the potential danger of "garbage" and "junk" memory.

2.) We can choose to play the Disco FX Asset to add flair to our game after the Starting BEAT has been Tap.
