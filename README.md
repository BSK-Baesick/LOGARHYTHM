# LOGARHYTHM
A Version Control Repository of "LOGARHYTHM"

SUMMARY:

Dive into a thrilling world of ARCADE as the RHYTHM starts to play the iconic songs of all times using BEATz to
convey message to people through emotions. In LOGARHYTHM, you follow the storyline of a man and a woman who falls in love with each other 
through music.

TAP, SWIPE or even SMASH the BEATz according to the gesture given on the screen to earn EMOpoints. Advance through the other
stage by finishing challenges, dethroning players along the DUEL MODE and beating bosses through music.
